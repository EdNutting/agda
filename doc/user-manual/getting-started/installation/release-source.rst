**********************************************
Installation using release-version from source
**********************************************

There are two ways to install from source. 
Use whichever one has been most successful for you in the past.
If this is your first time using Agda, use whichever method has 
worked for you with other Haskell-based tools in the past.
If this is your fist time using any Haskell-based tool - good luck (try Stack first).

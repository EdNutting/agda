.. _installation-emacs-mode:

*****************************
Configure agda-mode for Emacs
*****************************

.. code-block:: bash

  agda-mode setup

The last command tries to set up Emacs for use with Agda via the
:ref:`Emacs mode <emacs-mode>`. As an alternative you can copy the
following text to your *.emacs* file:

.. code-block:: emacs

  (load-file (let ((coding-system-for-read 'utf-8))
                  (shell-command-to-string "agda-mode locate")))

It is also possible (but not necessary) to compile the Emacs mode's
files:

.. code-block:: bash

  agda-mode compile

This can, in some cases, give a noticeable speedup.

**Warning**: If you reinstall the Agda mode without recompiling the
Emacs Lisp files, then Emacs may continue using the old, compiled
files.
